In this task, you will use a web-based PostgreSQL client ("pgweb") to connect to Redshift.

Copy the pgweb IP address shown to the left of these instructions.
This is the IP address of a web server that is running the pgweb software.

Open a new tab in your web browser, paste the IP address and hit Enter.
You will be presented with the pgweb login screen.

Configure the following settings:
Username: 
master
Password: 
Redshift123
Database: 
lab
Port: 
5439
 (which is different to the default value)



 To the right of the screen, Copy the Endpoint to your clipboard.
The endpoint will look similar to: lab.czvdbh5dsk9y.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/lab

Remove the :5439/lab ending so that the Host value ends with: .com
