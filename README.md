# Bigdata-on-AWS

worked with an Amazon Redshift cluster to analyze USA Domestic flight data.

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze all your data using your existing business intelligence tools. It is optimized for datasets ranging from a few hundred gigabytes to a petabyte or more and costs less than $1,000 per terabyte per year, a tenth the cost of most traditional data warehousing solutions

Amazon Redshift delivers fast query and I/O performance for virtually any size dataset by using columnar storage technology and parallelizing and distributing queries across multiple nodes. Weâ€™ve made Amazon Redshift easy to use by automating most of the common administrative tasks associated with provisioning, configuring, monitoring, backing up, and securing a data warehouse.
