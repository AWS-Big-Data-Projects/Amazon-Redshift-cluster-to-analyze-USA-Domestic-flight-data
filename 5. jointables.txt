n this task, you will load more data and then run queries that join information between tables.

Run this query to create a new table for aircraft information:
CREATE TABLE aircraft (
  aircraft_code CHAR(3) SORTKEY,
  aircraft      VARCHAR(100)
);

A new aircraft table will appear in the left-side table list.

Paste the following text into pgweb but do not run it yet:
COPY aircraft
FROM 's3://us-west-2-aws-training/awsu-spl/spl-17/4.2.9.prod/data/lookup_aircraft.csv'
IAM_ROLE 'INSERT-YOUR-REDSHIFT-ROLE'
IGNOREHEADER 1
DELIMITER ','
REMOVEQUOTES
TRUNCATECOLUMNS
REGION 'us-west-2';


Run the query.

This will load 383 different types of aircraft flown by the carriers.

Run this query to view 10 random rows of aircraft data:
SELECT *
FROM aircraft
ORDER BY random()
LIMIT 10;

content_copy
The table contains an aircraft code and an aircraft description. The two tables can be joined together to provide useful information:

Run this query to view the most-flown types of aircraft:
SELECT
  aircraft,
  SUM(departures) AS trips
FROM flights
JOIN aircraft using (aircraft_code)
GROUP BY aircraft
ORDER BY trips DESC
LIMIT 10;

content_copy
The results show the friendly name of aircraft that are flown on most trips. The JOIN command links the flight table with the aircraft table.
